		   CORE-V GCC Development

NOTE: This is not the standard GNU GCC. For that repository go to
git://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git.

This is the repository for CORE-V GCC development prior to submitting for
inclusion upstream. It has at most only two branches

1. development - this is where the active development continues. This branch
tracks upstream FSF GCC and incorporates changes for CORE-V. It should always
compile and pass tests.

2. stable - if it exists, this branch is an occasional snapshot of the
development branch, at points of significant CORE-V feature enhancement.  This
branch has always been thoroughly tested.

The remainder of this file is the standard FSF README file for gcc

This directory contains the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

The GNU Compiler Collection is free software.  See the files whose
names start with COPYING for copying permission.  The manuals, and
some of the runtime libraries, are under different terms; see the
individual source files for details.

The directory INSTALL contains copies of the installation information
as HTML and plain text.  The source of this information is
gcc/doc/install.texi.  The installation information includes details
of what is included in the GCC sources and what files GCC installs.

See the file gcc/doc/gcc.texi (together with other files that it
includes) for usage and porting information.  An online readable
version of the manual is in the files gcc/doc/gcc.info*.

See http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs/ for how to report bugs usefully.

Copyright years on GCC source files may be listed using range
notation, e.g., 1987-2012, indicating that every year in the range,
inclusive, is a copyrightable year that could otherwise be listed
individually.
